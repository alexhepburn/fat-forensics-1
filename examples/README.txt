Examples
========

Here you can find various examples of using FAT Forensics.

.. note::
   Please note that all of the examples using the
   :class:`fatf.utils.models.models.KNN` model class may be slow as our
   implementation of the k-nearest neighbours algorithm is in pure Python,
   hence is rather slow.
